# Observing Suite

Welcome to the Documentation for the `observing-suite` package. Here you can use the left hand panels to navigate either the examples/tutorials I've put together for the code's usage, or the API, which will show the docstrings for the classes and functions that make up the code. 

Click next below to check out the overview, where I guide you through the basic usage of the code.

This guide has been compiled with `jupyter-book` using the `sphinx-autoapi` package.
